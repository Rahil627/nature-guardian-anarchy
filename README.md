# The Way
[todo: need a title]

The Way of Nature provides a digital common space for people that either live in nature are striving to go back to nature. It's also a place for the people that strive to protect these people. It's also a place for people that make tools (digital or not) to aid these people.

Now, obviously, most of those people don't use Discord, or speak English, or think anywhere near the way I am currently thinking as i write this.., so this is likely a space for people who have lived in both cultures/worlds/mind-sets: indgenous / in nature and with technology ("developed" and "undeveloped"). Very likely, it's people that either migrated from the technological world to nature or from nature to the technological world. It's for grassroots communities 'n their communes in nature ("intentional communities"). But, of course, it would be nice to move everyone from social media to Discord.

It's up to us to make a digital world that fits our own world, in the language we live. I personally have a set of tool ideas to aid buskers, to aid street-vendors, to aid people living in nature, for us.

But I wonder what others out there, in some remoate area in the world, may be up to...
